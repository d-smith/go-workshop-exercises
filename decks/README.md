The materials in these slides take a lot of the text and examples from the
[Go Language Specification](https://golang.org/ref/spec)

The intent of the slides is to summarize materials in the langauge spec,
broken into small pieces that can be sequenced in introducing people to
the Go language. 

To present the decks, first grab the present command:

<pre>
go get golang.org/x/tools/cmd/present
</pre>

Then run it:

<pre>
present
</pre>

You then point to http://localhost:3999/
